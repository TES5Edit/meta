[size=5][color=#ff0000]NOTE: Anti-virus programs cause unwanted delays and issues with TES5Edit. Be sure to disable them if you are experiencing any unusual behavior. Kaspersky antivirus is one that is known to cause issues.[/color][/size]

[size=6][color=#ff0000]We don't support TES5Edit when used with ModOrganizer[/color][/size]

None of us use MO so there is no way for us to guide you through any settings changes that would assist you.  However, feel free to ask the community but, you may not receive a quick response or a response at all. Hiding the fact that you are using MO thinking that someone can still help won't be of any use to you.  ModOrganizer uses programs that alter your file system so that it can create virtual folders for the mods.  People not using MO won't be able so troubleshoot TESEdit in that environment because of the differences when using MO.  If you are using Mod Organizer you should read the documentation, look for Youtube Videos, and after that direct any other question to the MO forum.

[url=https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids]GophersVids[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/user/gamerpoets]GamerPoets[/url] and the [url=http://wiki.step-project.com/Guide:Mod_Organizer]STEP Guide[/url] are good resources for MO.

[size=5][color=#3366ff]When discussing the program[/color][/size]

Please view the forum thread and search for your question, read the description page, watch the video on the unsupported Merge patch, or review the documentation for previous versions before posting. When reviewing the outdated documentation most will still apply. When it does not apply directly, please preform some of the steps and make changes to the plugin. By doing so you will see what has changed and how the function works for Skyrim.  Remember you should be making a backup before using TES5Edit. If you feel you made a mistake when making changes you can exit TES5Edit without saving.

[size=5][color=#3366ff]When reporting a bug[/color][/size]

Before you do anything, Can you reproduce the issue? Try to reproduce your bug using a recent version of the software, to see whether or not it has already been fixed. Be precise, be clear and explain how to reproduce the problem, step by step, so others can reproduce the bug. Include any special setup steps. Explain in which part of the software the bug occurs. If you were preforming a specific procedure, explain what you are doing when the bug occurs. Explain the actual result of and the expected result for the bug you are reporting. Don't provide your suggested solution. An appropriate solution will be provided within the boundaries of the intended use and goal of the program.

[size=5][color=#3366ff]When discussing merging Mods[/color][/size]

It is clearly stated on the description page that merging mods is not supported but you can try at your own risk. When attempting to do so, and you have questions, it is clearly stated to start your own thread. Links to resources are given as a courtesy. Those resources are in no way endorsed or supported by TES5Edit or it's developers. Merging mods is a very complex task and should only be preformed by people with advanced modding experience. Novice to beginner users attempting to merge mods should do so at their own risk and expect to make multiple errors before getting it right. Intermediate users of TES5Edit could try but with caution.

[size=5][color=#3366ff]What you should not expect[/color][/size]

TES5Edit is not a hand holding tool. There may be functions available in TES5Edit that are not intended to be used how you want to use them. One record could reference 1 to 10 other records. Those records could be native to the plugin or belong to the masters of the plugin. It is your responsibility to know which records and functions will be needed to do what you want. For example if you copy a record from one plugin to another you need to know whether or not any other records should be copied as well. If you want to change a FormID you need to have preformed other actions to make sure that the change will effect the plugin correctly. When using scripting to automate tedious processes you should test it thoroughly to make sure it does exactly what you want.

Do not expect answers to questions about specific records, subrecords, and what will happen to a plugin if you edit certain values. That is asking about the plugins, not the program. Questions should be limited to asking about the program itself. Meaning that asking how to start TES5Edit to use specific strings files for languages supported by Skyrim, is specifically about TES5Edit. How to navigate the tree on the left, or how to drag and drop values on the View tab are also questions about the program itself.

[size=5][color=#3366ff]Where to ask plugin specific questions[/color][/size]

Posting in the [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/184-the-creation-kit/]Skyrim CK forum[/url] is primarily community based support. The [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Main_Page]CK Wiki[/url] is primarily updated by the community. I have yet to be able to ask plugin specific questions and receive an answer from a Bethesda developer.  The UESP Wiki has plugin information for [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Mod_File_Format]Oblivion[/url], and [url=http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes5Mod:Mod_File_Format]Skyrim[/url].  When posting in the CK forum you are normally expected to have done your homework by watching Youtube videos, reading the CK Wiki, and searching for other posts. Even if you are a Novice or Beginner and attempting to learn the CK you are told to go watch Youtube tutorials, read the CK wiki, and look for other posts.

When you ask a question in the CK forum if it has been asked before or it appears that you could have found your answer elsewhere you are normally referred back to those resources. It's not because the community is unhelpful it's because they expect you to understand what you are asking about to begin with. How can you really ask a question if you don't understand how plugins work, how the GECK or CK works, and how the plugin will work when used with Skyrim. As well as Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and Oblivion of course.

All versions of Edit are based off of plugins made from the GECK or CK for each respective game. If the GECK or the CK can't do it then it's not available in Edit. There are a few exceptions of course. So when you edit plugins you are changing plugins made by the GECK or the CK, they aren't our files. For that reason you need to be using the same resources you would for the GECK or CK for plugin specific questions.
