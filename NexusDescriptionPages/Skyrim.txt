[color=#00BFFF]DirectX Information:[/color]

As of 3.1 this is no longer needed.

If you are using a version prior to 3.1 and you get an error about d3dx9_*.dll not being installed, you need to update your DirectX to the most current version.  [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109]DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)[/url] or [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23611]DirectX End-User Runtimes (March 2008)[/url] or [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35]DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer[/url].  (make sure to install it after unpacking it)

[color=#00BFFF]Future of TES5Edit:[/color]

We appreciate all the thanks and support from the community.  We would like to thank all the users that made bug reports on the Nexus or in the Bug Tracker.  Zilav and Hlp continue to make various bug fixes and improvements.  Zilav has added more scripting functions while Hlp is still working on having a working Save game editor.  Currently early testing only allows you to view save games.  We were very excited recently when ElminsterAU had some time to make some optimizations to the code.  The program loads plugins faster then before and uses less memory.

[color=#00BFFF]Cleaning Plugins and official DLC:[/color]

I am still seeing many posts where people state that they have cleaned multiple plugins at the same time.  I understand that the cleaning process seems tedious and it would be nice to fire off the program to clean 200 plugins while you go do something else.  Unfortunately there are still no plans on adding an automated way to clean multiple plugins or access to TES5Edit from the command line.  Being there to see what errors might be reported during the cleaning process ensure that you are aware of potential issues that can lead to instability while playing Skyrim.

Cleaning multiple plugins at once can and will lead to erroneous cleaning and can in many cases lead to unwanted crashes to the desktop.  Please look at the Cleaning Tutorial or watch the cleaning videos.  They show both loading the plugins you know are required or show only loading the one plugin and letting TES5Edit load any other dependencies.  After applying the filter for cleaning, clean only the one plugin.  It is imperative that the process is repeated for each individual separate plugin that you wish to clean.

Currently cleaning a plugin involves indexing over a million references at times.  When only the required plugins are loaded then the cleaning is accurate.  If unnecessary plugins are involved those become part of the index and could cause the plugin to lose important and required data.  Without human intervention too many issues during the cleaning process would go unnoticed and make troubleshooting game issues related to plugins even more difficult then it already is.

[color=#00BFFF]Cleaning Plugins and official DLC when a new version of TES5Edit is released:[/color]

It is not always necessary to clean all your plugins every time a new version of TES5Edit is released.  More often then not an ITM does not cause Skyrim to crash.  What can lead to crashes are deleted references which are resolved as part of the cleaning process when you choose "Undelete and Disable References".  It is still important to remove "Identical to Master" records for a more stable game but not as vital to eliminating crashes.  The other causes for crashes are corrupt plugins, poorly written and managed scripts, and missing files required by the plugin.  If Skyrim is working for you leave things the way they are.  It's not really required unless we make some major update in the cleaning process.  If you feel you must clean the official Bethesda ESM files then restore any backups you have.  However, it is much more reliable to use the Verify Cache feature from Steam.

[color=#00BFFF]Using TES5Edit in place of the CK:[/color]

As TES5Edit becomes more widely used in the Skyrim community it has become a concern that many people still want to use the utility in place of the Construction Kit.  This is still not recommended.  We work hard to make TES5Edit as accurate as possible but development is directly related to the plugins themselves.  TES5Edit can not replicate all the changes that the CK will make.  Attack Data is the best example.  Merely checking or unchecking certain things for an NPC will alter the attack data dramatically.  We won't be adding those types of things to TES5Edit.

Please understand that we don't directly support the use of TES5Edit to make major changes to plugins.  Aside from all the things the CK will change in a plugin that TES5Edit cannot replicate, Skyrim will react the same way to changes made to a Plugin with TES5Edit.  If you have questions about changes you are making to plugins or how Skyrim will react to your changes please direct all questions to the [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/184-the-creation-kit/]Skyrim CK thread[/url].  All changes you could make in the CK are covered in the [url=http://www.creationkit.com/Main_Page]CK Wiki[/url] and therefore don't need to be covered in any TES5Edit documentation.

[color=#00BFFF]Merging Plugins:[/color]

There is still a demand for merging multiple plugins but merging plugins is still unsupported by the TES5Edit team.  There is a [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37981]TES5Edit script by Matortheeternal[/url] for merging plugins.  Some mods cannot be successfully merged with it and you should direct all questions relating to the script to the author.  There is [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?showtopic=1033740]a thread available[/url] where people have posted which plugins merge successfully or unsuccessfully.  For more info on ways to use TES5Edit to Merge Plugins check out [url=http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/904953-how-to-merge-multiple-mods-with-multiple-master-files]How To Merge Multiple Mods With Multiple Master Files[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1425724-merging-mods]Merging Mods[/url].  Otherwise if you intend on editing masses of entries, merging plugins, and creating compatibility patches for Skyrim overhauls please create your own separate thread.

[color=#00BFFF]Previous versions such as FO3Edit, FNVEdit, TES4Edit:[/color]

We understand that sometimes updates to programs break things.  Please use the updates with caution.  However, please use them and then report issues so we can improve the program.  Our goal is to make all versions as bug free as possible and introduce new features that are useful for the modding community for all the Bethesda games this utility supports.

  * Race: Hairs, Eyes, Spells
  * Containers
  * Relations
  * Form Lists
  * Keywords on: Armor, Weapon, Ammo, NPC

  * NPC's tints are now sorted by tint index for better conflicts detection
  * QUST aliases are no longer sorted by index
  * QUST stages are now sorted by stage index
  * Improved NavMeshes (thanks to Divstator)
- [TES5] FaceFX phonemes where empty after copying RACE record.

- [TES5] Create start-enabled quests sequence SEQ file (you can select several files at once).
- [TES5] Improved error checking.

- No autosaves when "you know what you are doing".
- Compare with external tool option in Edit window.

- Saving messages to [TES5/FNV/FO3/TES4]Edit_log.txt upon exit.
- Fixed minor bug when Edit can't find game's folder. If your registry settings is invalid due to a Steam bug and Edit is unable to find your game, put it in the game's root folder where the game executable file is (Oblivion.exe, TESV.exe, etc).
- Reason: The game's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, because Steam likes to remove it whenever the game is updated or its game cache is verified. Run the game's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.

[size=4][color=#FF8C00]FAQ:[/color][/size]

Q: I have the following errors with one of my plugins what do I do?

[00:43] Background Loader: Error: record ARMA contains unexpected (or out of order) subrecord MODL
[00:43] Background Loader: Errors were found in: ShieldofYsgramorDraugrAA [ARMA:01001001]

A: I have seen that occur with plugins made with the ReProccer, NPC Editor, and older buggy versions of TESVSnip.  Usually TESVSnip 4.2 or 4.3.x.  TESVSnip never used the proper compression which is ZLib so the files are improperly compressed or they were left uncompressed.  No matter how the plugin was made it will cause issues during game play.  You can either continue to use them but they may cause game instability, report the errors to the author so they can be addressed, or uninstall them.
